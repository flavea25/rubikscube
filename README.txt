My Computer Graphics project consists of a Rubik's Cube created in Unity.
Please unzip the project file in order to use it.

There is a folder inside the project called WebGLDemo; if you access the demo.html file in that folder, you'll have a Demo variant of the program: the only difference is that, when shuffling, it only makes one move, in order to ease the process of solving the cube and see the results faster. The only line modified for the Demo is in the "Automate" C# script --> in the method Shuffle().

To run the program, access the index.html file from the main folder.
A start screen appears; read the instructions there: in order to start the timer, you have to shuffle the cube (press the SHUFFLE button in the left-bottom corner). In order to check if you've completed the cube, press the CHECK button: a different pop-up window will appear, depending on the cube's state.
The cube is easy to control. The controls are also presented on the page: to rotate the cube, use the right-click mouse button, to make moves on different sides of the cube, use the left-click mouse button. Also, if you press the 'm' key on the keyboard, you cand mute/unmute the background music.

I was unable to attach the full program, since it's too big.
However, I attached in the folder CODE the C# scripts used for the game.
